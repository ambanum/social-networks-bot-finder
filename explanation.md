# What is a bot ? 

Defining what counts as a bot account is not as direct as it seems. For instance, some accounts are sometimes used by bots and sometimes by humans; these accounts are called cyborg and further complicate the definition.
In this work we do not try to define what a bot account is (many attempts have already been made in the scientific literature). 
We consider as a bot the accounts marked as so in the bot repository of the Indiana University (https://botometer.osome.iu.edu/bot-repository/datasets.html). We then classify a Twitter account according to how similar it is to these accounts, based on several features detailed below.

## How does the bot probability score work ?

To compute the probability for an account to be a bot, we train a Random Forest classifier on the data aggregated from the bot repository, which is available (as a csv file) in DatasetConsolidated.zip in this repository.

We use 21 different features : 
- statuses_count : the number of statuses (tweets) posted by the account 
- followers_count : the number of followers of the account
- favourites_count : the number of tweets the account has marked as favourite
- friends_count : the number of friends (following accounts) this account has
- listed_count : the number of public list this account is member of
- default_profile : whether the account has uploaded a new profile image or uses the default image instead
- profile_use_background_image : whether the account has uploaded a new background image
- verified : whether the account has been verified by the Twitter team
- age : the age (in days) of the account (this is rounded to the upper number so that there is no dividing by zero for the subsequent features)
- name_length : the length (in number of characters) of the name (which is @name) of the account
- screenname_length : the length (in number of characters) of the screen name (which is the name that is most visible) of the account
- name_digits : the number of digits in the name (which is @name) of the account
- screen_name_digits : the number of digits in the screen name (which is the name that is most visible) of the account
- description_length : the length (in number of characters) of the account description
- tweet_frequence : the growth rate of the tweets (statuses) posted - this is equal to : statuses_count/age
- followers_growth_rate : the growth rate of followers acquired - this is equal to : followers_count/age
- favourites_growth_rate : the growth rate of tweets favorited - this is equal to : favourites_count/age
- friends_growth_rate : the growth rate of friends acquired - this is equal to : friends_count/age
- listed_count_growth_rate : the growth rate of list - this is equal to : listed_count/age
- friends_followers_ratio : number of friends per follower - this is equal to friends_count/(followers_count+1)
- followers_friends_ratio : number of followers per friend - this is equal to followers_count/(friends_count+1)


Based on the features observed in the data, we follow the Random Forest classifier algorithm : we creates several (in our case 250) Decision Trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) to help us classify unknown (that is : unlabeled) Twitter accounts. Each Decision Tree is trained using only a subset of the training data (this technique is called _bootstrap aggregating_).

When computing the class of an account using a single Decision Tree, the account is assigned to a specific leaf in the decision tree : its class probability of being a bot is then the number of bot training samples which were assigned this leaf over the total number of training samples which were assigned this leaf.

**The probability that an account is a bot is then computed as the average of the class probability of the account for all the different decision trees.**

## Example

Suppose for instance that an account has an abnormally high tweet frequence. In the training dataset some accounts also have this particularity and are labeled as "bot". During the building of the random forest, some Decision Tree will be created that uses the tweet_frequence feature to assign a bot label to the accounts that have a high tweet_frequence feature. 

When we have ended the training phase we now have a forest of Decision Trees. We pick an account for which we want to have a probability. For each of the Decision Tree in our forest, the account will follow the different nodes of the tree up to a specific leaf in the tree. This leaf will be labeled either "bot" or "human" and it will have a probability for each of these labels. The probability of the label "bot" is equal to how many training examples of 'bot' account ended up in this leaf divided by the total number of training examples, whether they are labeled 'bot' or 'human', that ended up in this leaf. The same process hapens for the label "human".

Because many Decision Trees inside our forest have used the tweet_frequence feature as an important piece of information to classify whether some accounts are bot or not, they will classify our unknown Twitter account as being a 'bot', unless some other features points towards the fact that the account is genuine : for instance the account could be verified by twitter.

To obtain the final probability that the account is a bot, we compute the average of the probability obtained by each Decision Tree and we are done !
